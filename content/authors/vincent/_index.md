I am a second-year Computer Science student with experiences in team programming challenges and a previous internship. I am a resilient learner and a good team player who is willing to take on challenges that require critical thinking and problem-solving. I am looking for a summer internship or placement opportunity in software product engineering, or related disciplines.
